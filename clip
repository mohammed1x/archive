00:07:37 - 00:08:12
in this okay it means I have increased the volume a little now it means I have made the volume a little okay it is equal and I will add a little gain okay right that means this is enough I will keep it below one okay right okay okay and let's just start it now the same spooky you know what is its description what does the description say description there is a new trend of an application that generates a spooky name for you user of that application later discovered that their real name ah real names where a magically


00:08:21 - 00:09:01
change has happened in their life okay could you help me bring down this application okay okay let's see though its source code has been given but this is a very easy challenge right so first do it randomly so or like this okay let's see what happens ok does it give in font etc. so what is the access etc. how many viewers are there 15 people are watching right and what is it bro can we see this later can my office It is going on so yes you can definitely see it, no its recording will remain no no means it will remain archived on this channel so you can see it anytime


00:09:02 - 00:09:43
right or it is written about YP gaming, right yes you can definitely see it, the recording will remain okay and what else was there and what was there, let's see, this can be access, let's try access, simple one, we have access, it is interesting, okay, there is access, why is it, let's see that as well, okay yes there is access, absolutely okay in this friend, usefully in this type of challenge, you no means it remains the same, what do you say, no, like if it was like access, then it has to be sent to the admin, then from there no flag has to be stolen,


00:09:53 - 00:10:51
it is something like that, no let's see it, but what is there about the admin here, friend the admin is not visible, its source code is also given somewhere, okay, once I upload it for a minute, I will upload it for a minute, we will also see its source code, we will see where it went , okay, the box password has come, okay this is its source code, okay let's see in it, what is given in it, ff did not do it friend, I commented, okay . Interesting okay blueprints there are routes in it okay it can be seen which one it is okay


00:12:32 - 00:13:27
there is nothing friend it is written UT in it okay let's make it bigger okay it is clear right okay you can also see it in 2K stream okay if someone is not able to see it clearly then Okay, it's all right, has anybody written anything? Anyway, what is there in this? The docker file has been given. This is given. The main has been given. Okay, the message is given. The error handler has been given. Okay, and there is a response, okay, what is given in the util? The font has been given. Okay, the font has been given. Brother, this is what is being accessed. This is also of the template. Which template


00:13:37 - 00:14:22
is Marco template? Okay, by the way, have you got access? You haven't done it. So, let's see. Does anything happen with this access? Okay, routes, nothing has been given in admin in this. PanelValue has not been given. Is there any admin? Panel is that also not there. What do I have to do with access? What should I do with the template? The template has been given. Let's check the tlet injection. Nothing came. This also didn't come. Which template is Marco, I have accessed the matrix.


00:14:37 - 00:15:20
Which Marco one is given in Pathan in this? It doesn't seem to have anything to do with access. I mean, what do I see with XS? No, I don't see any access. I mean, I have got access as well. But what should I do with this? I mean, that might be something. It is not working, is n't it friend, it is a web challenge, I have given the complete source code as well, right? So SST must have come , let's take a look once, it is equal to I have put the wrong payload or have put the wrong payload, well this is direct, is there no need to test it,


00:15:26 - 00:16:07
okay, it seems direct, this is it, okay, why is nothing coming, are you fooling me, what is going on, there is nothing to do with xs in this, nothing is happening in SST either, once 500 has come or or okay, now the comment is coming, yes it is clear bro, hunt in a VDP program [laughs] no, Josh has written, no, no, no, no, all that will not happen on this channel, okay, look, if you are asking about bug hunting only, then this is a little better than that, no, in this the thinking process is seen a little better,


00:16:19 - 00:16:59
no, that you know, how is the person thinking ahead, I mean how am I thinking, you know, and actually this is much better, you know, if you have to learn, look at me, okay, if this is your thought, then no, I mean I am saying this because I am saying this because the VDP is Nah good is the sound low ok ok do I have to add a little gain okay wait I'll take it close okay no look that thing is like this I mean how do I explain it look I'll also hunt with lets so I mean how is it in that things are seen in one direction in this CTF in this everything has to be seen so


00:16:59 - 00:17:36
this is much better if you think you are like this then you know this is much better you are watching while playing CTF I am telling you what am I thinking what am I not thinking so that is much better it seems like this to me no so that is the same okay and what have you written when did you start no it got a little late I started on 72 what have I written since when have you been doing this app here all this ok since when have you been doing all this is the question not equal bro why is this stream playback not happening no


00:17:36 - 00:17:58
friend when it ends only after that you will be able to see again from the beginning I have kept that intentionally you know then people see the back and I see the front If I am running, then once it ends, it will be done. I haven't done anything like that till now, meaning it has just started, no, it has just started, you know, nothing has happened yet, I have just got access and it doesn't seem to have anything to do with access. You know, it seems to be the SSTI one because there is no admin panel, there is nothing, so what should I do


00:17:58 - 00:18:29
about XS too, so it will most likely be the SSTI one. So they are looking at it. And how do you approach a web app, I approach it the way I am doing it right now. And what brother, at a high level, I mean I see everything, friend, everything, you know, how everything works, see the normal flow, what is it like, after that I will see it like that. Okay, if I do that gradually, then you will also be able to see what I do, what doesn't it mean it may or may not be visible, I don't know how it looks. No, that is up to you. Please make the playback


00:18:29 - 00:18:57
available after the start. Yes, it will definitely be there. It will be archived. You can see that Sir Tarun has asked. So yes, you can see it absolutely. You can see it, okay, when it ends then you can watch the whole thing, it will be archived, yes there are already many videos of bug hunting, it is true, no there are many more videos of bughunting brother and you can't really exploit anything, okay yes, I mean yes, I mean you can exploit it publicly, the platform will ban me, if it sees it, then how long


00:18:57 - 00:19:36
have you been in the hacking field, well has Satya asked like this, Satya has asked how long have you been in the hacking field, look friend. I started around 10th, in 10th, that means, when I first saw Script KD, I knew SQL maps, etc., I have been into Script KD since then. Are you strong with a particular bug type, strong, I would say strong, such a strong, such a very strong part, it seems good, I mean, it is internal, I understand it completely, that is a little bit good, I would say, everything else is strong, I mean, you


00:19:36 - 00:20:10
have to Google it well, there is no understanding, it happens, it is not like that, then someone asked, you know what bugs do you focus on, mainly, I see, I do it according to the target, according to the target, okay, why, give me some tips for secondary context part reversal, secondary context part traversal, friend, I am not that good with terminology, nomenclature, etc., I mean, a little bit about this, so how is the second context part exactly, I don't know. I might have of course exploited it but I


00:20:10 - 00:20:37
don't see much of terms like that, I mean honestly many people ask about second idea or second order idea, I haven't done anything like that, I mean I would have let it be that much, I would have just left it at that impact and you know just like that, I mean I haven't learned anything like that from him, you know any study material or anything like that, you know so sometimes I have a little bit of you know terms, so it's like that, yaar, yaar, he will tell you better than me, is


00:20:37 - 00:21:15
n't it? The question is good but that's fine, now I'm learning the fundamentals, so where should I start, yaar, yaar, start with whatever you find, do CTF etc., see its sessions, you will find it in that, okay so let's move ahead, where were you, you were here, okay, isn't it, yaar Marco SS or he has not written the write up, what has he written, he has written the whole blog, okay, let's see it and has anyone written anything about Posgar, let's see in this, where is the payload


00:21:23 - 00:22:02
yaar, where is it yaar, what is this, the direct of Mako Why are you not able to find it, what is it, I don't say maco, I say maco, right? So just fine, this is the one, is it visible only one, don't you pick it up and put it everywhere, okay friend, I will say it like this, why does it say it is an encoding issue, do you mean what is the issue, what is it, look this chat is a little on the right side, I will solve it, I cannot see it, that means it is absolutely fine, so okay, this back end API something dot dot


00:22:06 - 00:22:36
going behind in internal, yes, that means that same thing, we go behind taking reverse toxic, yes, yes, okay, so just do the same, usually see, it was like this, he has asked for his username in Japanese or Chinese, okay, look then it was like this, so we have to see by brute force, no, I mean we have to see whether a valid path is being hit, let's say for example, let's understand like this, like see this, okay, I will give it, now that I have come till here, let's talk, okay, like it is local host, okay, local host 300


00:22:36 - 00:23:26
or 400 is given anyway, okay and API Rest V1 is okay and here we control, okay, control is okay and this is its public URL, okay www.t.com [music] okay and API proxy is written or reverse is also written, okay and then API V1 and here we are injecting, okay, this is here, here we control, okay, now whatever we put here, it goes here, then its result comes and then it shows here, okay, that means it is like a reverse proxy, okay, load balancer etc. there are a lot of things there, so I think this is what you are asking, second order etc. so, yes, I did this a lot,


00:23:26 - 00:24:00
actually, I did not find the term a little familiar, you know, I do not think that much about terms etc., you know, I just see what should have happened and what is happening and why it is happening and what should not have happened and how can I make money from this, you know, I mean what is its impact, so I think like that, so Anyway , look, you are controlling it, so look, like this, you just inserted it after putting a dot dot in it, okay, so what is happening now, the dot dot, this is here, okay, let's copy it, okay, it is


00:24:00 - 00:24:26
getting reflected here, okay, this controlled is getting reflected on this, okay, then it will resolve and come till here, meaning this thing will get removed, this dot dot has been inserted, isn't it? And if you put x here, then x will come here as well, okay, will it get removed, there is dot dot twice, so this will get removed, okay then after this API slash and x will remain, no? Do you understand what I am saying? So the x will remain there, so brute force it there. By brute force I mean to try and


00:24:26 - 00:24:49
see what you get after API, no, you got some doc, some file, sometimes you get dot get, you know this is also internal, so ah you know anything can be found, so see when it is becoming stable after dot dot, so that response has to be understood that it is really becoming stable, 400 is coming, 400 is coming, so there is some issue as well, doesn't it mean that there is some problem as well, so if there is that type of thing, then that has to be tried and seen, so that request and response, means


00:24:49 - 00:25:31
on the response, how is it happening, the response has to be observed a little bit carefully that what pattern is being formed and what is not being formed, okay, so like that, it is a very good question, okay, and was this happening because of encoding, why is it happening like this? I was thinking what is it, do I need a new line, what is this new line, what has Srinath written, okay, 20K USD 20 is good, I want to earn $2000 as a beginner, the amount is quite good, what will you do, as a beginner, if you start streaming etc, you will be behind the leader board,


00:25:32 - 00:26:06
so Tesla brother, why has it been written like this, you will be left behind, what is it like that, no no, in the beginning, when I started everything right away, no one wrote that Tesla got wrong and then the reputation a lot, so that's why I told you that it is not about reputation, it is about money, you know, it is a matter of money, I am okay with it, you know, lately I submitted only one bug in a single month and I got 50 for it, so it is okay for me, I don't care about reputation, you know, what do I mean reputation, no, I do


00:26:06 - 00:26:43
n't eat reputation in my food , that's why I wrote that, anyway no, it was nonsense, I don't know why it was written. X is there, isn't it good? Okay, I am not a beginner, okay, as a beginner, yes, multiple people have written, alright, I don't know, okay, let 's see , we will have to remove it, okay, look at this, usefully, when it takes time, like the response is taking a lot of time, not now, it is taking time for the response to come, usefully, it is good news, I mean, it is processing,


00:26:52 - 00:27:24
you know, sometimes if there is too much processing, what do they say, I mean, Cloud Flare's timeout comes, so it remains for a while, the same Shreyas dude, care WhatsApp all right, I want to ask about that, friend, I didn't like this YouTube chat etc. that much, you know, they answer in it very quickly, people write, they keep backing off, no, I didn't find it that special, let me honestly tell you, there was a good one on Twitter, why is it taking so much time, what happened, what happened,


00:27:40 - 00:28:18
500 is also coming, something is also going wrong, let's look at the source code once, okay brother, as far as the question answers are concerned, it doesn't get solved, all the attention remains on that, okay. Anyway okay so this is the template injection one, okay I have got server side template injection SST, I got it in the past as well, it was good, I got it a long time ago, I haven't got it recently, friend, if there is a waf etc. then things become very different, where is the index, it is static, okay, let's see on the main menu, okay, the result


00:28:25 - 00:29:16
message is okay, it is in YouTube, it will be here, okay, let's see here, I have been putting basic challenger for so long, anyway actually I was about to do it in virtual box, but I don't know suddenly you know it was not opening, give one more line at the end, what happened or was my attention, thank you yes for telling, I don't have to pay attention to this chat white, this is a little sting, what was I thinking, who told me, Mr. Kamboj told, okay, tell me properly, okay, what's going wrong,


00:29:28 - 00:30:20
friend , wait a minute, even the basic basic is not happening, okay, 49 happens, nothing will come, have you got a job offer from company two, but I did not do it, yes so One had come recently and one had come earlier so one, you know, it was a good company etc. but no, I never thought about it, I mean he is not straight forward, answer no, so I mean I do not want to do a job etc. no, I have come so far, just now, you know, I can't go back right now, what has happened, I will just surrender like this


00:30:53 - 00:31:30
[music] I am not in a job, right now I mean I will do it full time, why is this happening friend, what am I missing is there any trick, what is happening, you should have read it once, okay, see, this happens here, no render, so this is the result and this 1 2 3 is happening on this but in Bug Bunty there is no work life balance, look work life balance depends friend, look you have a lot of money, so you can take a very long break, it's a straight forward thing, I mean if you have a lot of money, then you can take it, so let's say no, you already have 40 crores


00:31:37 - 00:32:04
lying in the bank, so you know in a year, you have to hunt only for three or four, that means you have to do one quarter, no or two quarters, no you can do this type of thing, no, if there is money, a lot happens, right, if there is no money, then there is no work life balance, it's true, no, I did not have enough money in the beginning, right now I have very little money, I have not reached yet where I want to go, so it depends on the money, Bug Bunty you know if there is a work life balance, if there is no money, then it's like that, you can stop anytime,


00:32:04 - 00:32:33
you know that I don't want to do it, no, two-three days, a week, a month, you know, it's up to you, if there's no money, then you know let's say you just Earned only $50,000 and you are again coming in work bounty, you know, then there will be stress, of course, it is the same, brother how much money did I earn, Josh has asked, okay , I don't understand these YouTube names, I mean what is the Twitter handle of the people who are asking, I don't understand a bit, but okay, so how much


00:32:33 - 00:33:13
have I earned, what should I tell you, friend, I am fine, I am a millionaire, multiple is quite good, okay, I mean see, currently it is so much that I mean people, I mean people also do jobs for many years, their CTC is more than that, only the bank interest comes, I mean you know, if I fill an FD in a small bank like a small finance bank, then I will get more than that, I mean I have that much from the people, so understand how much is it, I mean brother it is not too much, not that much, my expectations are very high, so just like that brother, how do you save tax,


00:33:14 - 00:33:40
I pay it fully, I don't save anything, I mean that, then I don't want any problem later that neither this nor that, then that much percentage penalty is being charged. So I don't need all that, that's why I fill it completely, I fill it properly and honestly, it's okay, what is missing friend, what is happening in this, okay, now let's pay attention to this, the tax has to be paid in full, friend, I can't do anything about it, then the problem is like this, then later the income tax people will come, no, then that means


00:33:40 - 00:34:15
there is a headache in it, then this two, that two, no, and then one doesn't become rich by saving money, a person becomes rich by earning money, so I focus on earning, I am just like that, mine is and where is it not in this, you are in this, okay, so let's see what is there in this, well it's not that easy, it seems we will have to look at it a little, okay, let's see, so this type is being rendered, okay, this is a variable and it is being rendered like this by converting the font, okay, so where did this go, where did this go now this is,


00:34:15 - 00:34:51
okay, so we also have tables etc. and what is there, we will have to look at it, okay and what is written, what is your real name, what is kept in the real name, friend, there is nothing in the real name. No brother there is public no there is no public some two three one two enter you know there are phone numbers etc. it's not like that it's not at all but I avoid it friend okay it's not that much meaning okay and what difference does it make friend whatever the name is what does one have to do with it it's like that yes meaning it's like this okay where were we render data


00:34:52 - 00:35:35
this that friend paid attention to this chat this is a big solution that is live events get missed out brother a live event I didn't understand mean like hacking events are you saying didn't understand mean you are saying life events we don't know Siddharth has asked okay let's see okay where is it and yes look LA no friend I don't have any desire at all for live hacking event hacker one etc. whatever it was earlier in the starting there is no one right now meaning if it is of my favorite target then it will be of course otherwise I have


00:35:36 - 00:36:10
zero interest in going you know and I have money I if I want to roam outside somewhere on foreign tour etc. this that I can do a trip, no no, anyway, so that 's not an issue, right? So, okay, let's see in this, how can there be only one payload in it, friend, what do you mean, I am not interested in it at all, I am not at all interested in that LCH, I mean, look, my thing is that if the target is good, then I do it, you know, I have never done it with any unknown target, you know, and then, you know, if I am standing there live


00:36:13 - 00:36:48
and doing it, then it will not give that much result, I think so. It's like that, I don't have any desire at all, how much time did it take to reach this stage, it did take time, friend, I don't know how much it took, in the last two-three years, I have made quite good progress, no, it's not like there was progress in the beginning as well, it's just that I didn't post on Twitter, that's a different thing, but there was progress, you know, I am just posting on Twitter, no, it's like that, everyone has their own time, some people


00:36:48 - 00:37:18
do it very fast, some people do it very slow, no, look, I would say friend, result and result, like bounties etc., that's fine, but I would say that one should be strong, one should not feel from within that I can continue more, this or that, etc., you know, because it is not necessary that if someone has done 100% of his work late, it is not necessary that he will be very strong, to be honest, it means it is like that too, you know, even for 100, 200, even for 150, you know, so from within, you know, he depends on the strategy, how is


00:37:18 - 00:37:58
the methodology, etc., from within. It seems that things happen through it I will say, you know, I won't judge by money, see, look from where do I feel that I develop methodology etc. in strong raw etc. then I feel that I have got something new, no, I have learned this new thing, now when I implement this new thing, then I feel in it, I mean I feel fee in it, no, you know, I am getting stung, you know, it's good, I mean new things are getting clicked, you know, so it remains in it, did you write it yourself or did you follow someone, well, you're asking about the methodology, well,


00:37:58 - 00:38:27
why did the message get redacted, I don't know friend, this is a big Twitter thing, what do you say, YouTube has a very different system, the same anyway, no, friend, the methodology is my own, follow someone etc. there's nothing like that, nothing, no, everything is something, I mean, I have seen one or two things completely, not without one point, whatever you like, you have to take it, not like that from someone, not that something like this is not like that at all, what is this, he has written, free


00:38:27 - 00:39:03
convert or It looks interesting but let's see it, then someone commented, then I no I have three monitors, no I have a three monitor setup, then I go to the right to see what is written, no now what has someone written, what do you think about AI, will it replace bugs under, look I think it is difficult, it is not that easy, I mean it is not that easy for bugs etc. and look let's have such a powerful AI, no so already so much code has been written which is written without AI, which has bugs, no so you know first some


00:39:13 - 00:39:42
company has to fix that too which has already been written, no the new code is fine but what will happen to the old code that has been written, no so that is also a thing, no so I don't think it will replace etc. no it can be a little less or more, this thing is not going to go away, I am sure of this much and I don't think that long term, to be honest, I look at 3 years, for 3 years it is fine. I hope I earn a lot of money in 3 years in the industry, that's what I am trying to do, then we will see about the future later, I think like this


00:39:42 - 00:40:16
in this because that is not in my hands, so there is no point in thinking that much, okay for three years it's fine, if you ask me then it's fine, what is written community boo edition okay community edition boo you are noisy bro yes, I mean community, there is community in it, though I use it pro, but community is also fine friend, it seems to be a repeater, this that, and there is a little extension no and the same because of meditation, ok, what did you write, see so much success, success yes, what is success, I don't feel that I


00:40:17 - 00:40:47
am doing that much, I mean I am doing well, but I am not very successful, you know success, I don't think I am successful, to be honest, things are going well, I cannot say that I am successful, you know, and there is no question of getting on top of my head, friend, what will get on top of my head, I know and what will it mean friend, in this, I have not become number one. Till now there is nothing like it getting on your head, you have to keep doing things and it is just like that Ansh has written, okay I have six months to graduate and I made some


00:40:47 - 00:41:42
like 20k till okay how did this go friend, how do I open the message again, where is it, hide this user, what is it friend, this moderation activity, one minute yes then it gets redacted friend, the comment has written something, one minute yes friend instead of solving it, only these things are happening, okay why is it getting redacted, what is another chapter, what is it, I keep the license comment moderation none, okay why is moderation happening, it was written upside down, is there channel activity in the comment, go


00:42:04 - 00:42:52
to channel, put user in time out, add as moderator, hey, what is this, I want to read what is written there, they keep participation popping out, what just came, where did it go, it got redirected again anyway, okay brother, have you done B.Tech, right? Yes, I have done B.Tech, friend, I have done B.Tech, okay, 20 means I am a graduate of 2023, okay, I am a 2023 grade, where were I, we got lost again, okay , what friend, I am not getting interested, what kind of challenge is this, someone had also written that it has been redacted, right? He must be writing again, someone


00:43:22 - 00:44:03
had also written that six months are left for graduation and I have made 20 after that I could not read, I don't know why YouTube redacted it, friend, what is this joke, what is moderation activity, what is this, moderation activity, why does this happen now, friend, we are very stupid in this, would you like, okay Well Siddharth has written that, the guy deleted it himself, maybe his information was getting docs, okay okay anyway, okay, thank you for telling me, let's see what it is now, let's see it, okay


00:44:11 - 00:44:43
, okay, then this converted result is like this, it gets formatted, then it gets templated, then it gets rendered, okay, okay, I have understood that it is access but it doesn't make any sense, this is server side template injection only, right , okay, let's see, okay, let's try it for one minute, it's not hitting at all, okay, what's the stupidity, I don't know, okay, what are people writing in the comments, people also write very long comments, that was very good on Twitter, people used to write things in short, that's okay, it


00:45:09 - 00:45:51
also takes time to read it, no, first I will solve it a little and then see, yes, see, this came, okay, it is 64, this is it, so why was it not telling in this, so what is the issue, what is going on in this, where did it go, it gave us of Python, okay, only this much has been given in it, nothing up and down, nothing, this also doesn't work. Its syntax is also different no what type of joke is it you know ok is it a variable one ok understood ok alright ok look I have written it again I have six months to graduate and made


00:45:52 - 00:46:24
like made like good money yes earlier you had written 20 k etc ok what do you suggest me like how can I improve as you already went through this face see I have also gone that is true ok it means you are assuming you are saying that you have to do it full time or not so I would say it should be 100 k in pocket friend mean at least you know after filling the entire tax and wax in liquid then a little remains no that is like that improve etc so then do hunt and do you know and play CTF etc read write ups etc


00:46:24 - 00:46:55
write tools wool develop your own methodology you know and that only happens you know mean you have to differentiate yourself from others in short you know if everyone will do the same then no money will be made mean means everyone will do the same If we do something then what is the difference between you and me, no, it is like that, okay and it is just like that, so write these tools etc., tools tools, okay, when that understanding will come then tools etc. will also come and I will say develop methodology etc.,


00:46:55 - 00:47:26
methodology, find good targets, see targets etc. just like that, it is not something very magical that I will tell and it will improve, look at some other methodology, do it well, find good targets and there should be good targets, the program should be good, no, so look at that and this is okay, progress is happening, I have run time, okay, let's see in this, it seems you will find it, import by the way, what is this, what do I mean, what am I seeing, why is it like this, it is not updated, okay, it belongs to someone else, what is stupidity


00:47:26 - 00:48:01
, what have I opened it, I wrote hectics and what is that, what should I say, now I only saw, okay anyway, be technically good, no, you should be technically strong, you know, I mean, look at eyedor etc. Everyone does simple exercises etc. and duplicates come out, then this happens, that happens, a lot of things happen, saying no means like this, so you should be technically strong, you should be very strong, fast, hunting, you should be fast in the sense that it means you should be able to take decisions quickly


00:48:07 - 00:48:53
, what to do and what not to do, so if it is a thing like that , it is just like that, there is no mention of what happened, how did the snap happen, nothing has been given in this either, friend, the impact has been given Okay, let's first solve it now. Okay, nothing has been solved at 8:00. Then let's make some progress first, then see the chat etc. Okay, what type of writing is this? Why do people write like this? Nothing has been given in it. There is no information in it. No payload, nothing, nothing. Time pass. It's garbage on the internet.


00:49:16 - 00:49:58
The entire payload, all the things. Okay, did he copy it from here? Nothing at all. What a joke. What kind of joke is it? It's very stupid, friend. What does this mean? I can't find any reference. Nothing, nothing. This is also big. This is also something different. No, similar. Easy to exploit. Okay, okay, okay. You know, I have done this before as well, but I don't want to do this again. You know, in this, I think, like these modules of Python, you know, then while importing them, you know, one


00:50:11 - 00:50:48
has to go to the OS one. It's of that type, I think this is very different. This is interesting. Okay , okay, okay. Have you given anything beyond that? Yaar again the same detection oh exploitation tell me yaar what is detection, that has been seen hi Tesla big fan ok is it alright today GPT generate does not load on chat GPT I do not use it at all that if I have to do that then this means within you know it means it is a matter of one second you know I do not use chat GPT at all I mean especially during CTF I


00:51:05 - 00:51:32
do not use it at all see you will have to understand how do I tell you see all this that I am doing so you know from this you get to learn four more things no it is like that and then these four things are used later no it is like that I do not use it at all I mean even if this challenge does not happen then it is better if I watch the session then I will learn more instead of chat GPT no which means it will bring it directly and give it to me no it is like that no I mean I do not use it at all no no


00:51:32 - 00:52:04
while playing CTF I use it only when I know that I will be able to do some x and z thing but it will take time So the time to save, the type that I want to save, I use it only then, you know, but when you know something that I need to do manually, then how will I learn, if he gives it in chat gpt, then that is it and then from that comes the intuition that this is not wearable, maybe it should be left, we should store it and we will see it later, no, so all that thinking is formed in that way, if you use chat gpt, then how will it be made,


00:52:04 - 00:52:42
because the quick decision is to be taken by me, that chat gpt will not be taken, so I have to develop it myself, so it is such a thing, I do not use it at all, otherwise it remains ready long ago, so I just have to make that payload, okay, let's see it once, I feel that this has something to do with it, okay or this is it, okay, the final payload, yes, this is what has to be made of this type, okay, I will show you once that You know what type it is, okay, I think we should put a dot, does it happen with a dot or


00:52:42 - 00:53:12
not, does it not happen with a dot, is it an underscore, doesn't it happen on the underscore, wait a minute, yes, the process is given here, okay, look, this is what it is, I have understood, what type it is, okay, so maybe I may not be able to explain it in a better way, but okay, I will try, okay, look, I also did self here, then this one came, okay, so this is an instance, sorry, there is an object inside that object, and then there are multiple modules, we can call them as, I mean, what do you call


00:53:12 - 00:53:48
it, we call it something too, friend, yes, look, we can call all the modules, so while calling, we have to go to the OS, okay, so look, it is already given here, so this OS module will be called, okay, I had done this a long time ago, my memory is still fresh, I had done it in CTF, I have not done this one, I solved the similar one in CTF, so in that, you have to make it by hand and usefully How is the process of making it by hand, see how the process is, okay like this, there is int in self, okay, now


00:53:48 - 00:54:29
there are multiples in neat, friend, just wait for a minute, yes, there are multiples and then we call it, then the things get listed and then progress is made in this way, no and like that, okay, I will do it directly, anyway, let it go, I think we list it like this, in this, there was the second one, that was of Jinja, in Python, I think, so just similar anyway, where is it, okay, let's pick one and do it directly, okay, this one works, I hope globals util util has os os It's okay in the system, utilpi was also there, right? It's in it,


00:54:37 - 00:55:15
what did it not get copied, where did it not go, what did it come, what happened, why should it be written like this, what is written can you tell you bro what are you trying to try to exploit something bro what are you doing, are you trying, yes it means server cert template injection, we are doing the same in it, no don't make the stream private brother, yes no it will remain public whatever it is, and this is the first stream, so I hope I will do a little more etc. etc. so brother it takes a lot of time to talk, right,


00:55:44 - 00:56:25
in chats, it's like that, the solution is getting less, no what is the system id, what's going wrong, one minute yes, I haven't seen the flag, where is the flag, we have the flag file by slashing it in the root directory, so brother it's the RC game only, we have to take the RC from it, okay, is there anything else in it, let's start first only, actually that payload should be constructed from the first one from today, but it's been a long time, I haven't exploited my core,


00:56:35 - 00:57:20
SST specially, so okay no Let's do it, what is he saying, he is also saying this, let's see, okay, self model cash UT system, what is it like this, what does it mean, what is it missing, okay, what is it like this, okay, I'll tell you, Demon Cyber ​​Sec has asked, okay, look at it first, you know, in this, the source code was already given, you know, it is visible straight forward, which template engine is it, okay, but usefully, you know, you have to test it one by one, so usefully,


00:57:33 - 00:58:09
there is a big polygod, it has a big payload, you have to create it and put it in every input, let's say you are doing bug bouncing or something, and some of it will also hit, no, see what is happening, so STI detects it like that, so that's the thing, usefully, there is a lot of this type of payload straight forward, cloud flare blocks it, then you have to find the real IP, and so it can be bypassed, anyway You can see if it blocks then it is a WAFF no and then what do you call it for bypassing, the origin IP has


00:58:09 - 00:58:49
to be found or something about it, no, something has to be bypassed, I remember I used to do it a long time ago, I used to play CTF a lot in 2019-20 etc. so I used to do it a lot, there are a lot of bypasses of it and it goes very crazy, SST means it is very crazy, if anyone has it then you know, I remember once I got SST but that means I have exploited it before also but once it was not getting exploited, how was it that I used to put it anywhere in the input field and it so you mean usefully polygod will work yes SST is simple so


00:58:49 - 00:59:17
definitely works yes this type of thing is as written, Shreyas has written it, it is written very correctly, so that type of work means that type of you know write it down and keep it somewhere and wherever you go, you can use it You have to keep pasting it, no your first name and last name will remain the same, no and if it is like that then yes, so what I was telling you, I received it once and the reflection of it used to come, I mean the output used to come in the email like, no, is it written in the email, you know, then here your name is there, okay


00:59:17 - 00:59:53
, and it is written that you want, you want something, whatever is written, friend, whatever message is there, no, it was written like that, so it used to be there in it, but friend, I don't know, things did not work in it, I don't know, what was there in the server side actually, no, I could not detect, so that was the lead, I mean I saw it, no lets, like this used to work, usually this this this period used to work, so 49 used to be written in it, then like if we do this, no 1 / 0, then the email did not come


00:59:53 - 01:00:20
because 1 0 is not possible, so it used to be false, then it would not proceed, there were a lot of things, you know, then what else did I enter, even if I entered something, the app used to tell etc. and many more It's an old thing, I mean it must have been about 2019 or 20, I guess friend, of 21, so it was like that then it did not get exploited, friend, I used to get mails everyday, you know, it is 49, it is 49, then there is, you know, 8, 64, 64, something, no, they used to come everyday and I used to see it everyday that


01:00:20 - 01:00:50
I was not able to exploit it, you know, but there is SSTI there, maybe, you know, many times, you know, developers etc. keep it by limiting it, no, you can do basic mathematics, I mean, mathematics calculations, but nothing impactful comes out of it, no, it is like solving a math problem there, you know, it is like that kind of thing and that did not happen, you know, to me He used to come everyday, then about a year or two ago, you know, then that too stopped coming, I think they fixed it, I guess someone found the exploit,


01:00:50 - 01:01:16
the working exploit, I couldn't find it, friend, but it was good, you know, I would have got 5k, if it would have been exploited, then that was the same, I don't know, no, I am not sure, you know, I think it was probably a sand box or what, you know, but it didn't get exploited and I mean, I invested a lot of time on that, so that was one, so there was one instance where it didn't get exploited, there were one or two instances where, you know, there was someone like that, just straight forward Python guy, he had worked on that, it's a very old thing,


01:01:16 - 01:01:59
actually I don't remember my bugs, okay, I mean, I am telling you, you will ask me, what I had submitted in January, what I had submitted in December, last year, I don't remember that, I don't remember at all, actually, I mean, what is it, what is it, it's like that, I mean, I submit a lot of bugs, it 's the same thing. Anyway and we get it, this is quite well written, okay, we will make something from this, the Facebook module itself, okay, let's start it and there is one more, SSTI, there is one minute,


01:02:00 - 01:02:37
SSTI, no exploit, someone had written a script which is also for direct exploit, yes, there is one by mapping SSTI, I had also used this at that time, but even then it did not happen, this is quite good, let's try it, straight forward, okay , lol, you know, good brother, you reminded me, this is quite good, I have also solved a lot of CTF etc. with this, so I hope this will work well, we will do it, okay, exploit is quite well written, it is ready, you just have to give the URL in it and you can give a lot of other things as well, so you have to give the URL


01:02:44 - 01:03:21
only and you have to give stars, which one is it, I mean where to exploit, it will do it accordingly, okay, you reminded me that there is also the instant sandbox one, yes, I have also thought about this, but it doesn't usually happen, friend, I mean the company, you know, does not accept it. This type of impact does it have, so the Jinja base was SSTi, yes it is true, but it was a sandbox, Shreyas has written it equally, okay, but I know about ds, they are not going to accept it, and it was not that type of company that they would accept it, no,


01:03:25 - 01:03:57
that is understandable, no, so it is like that, and I let it go, then it got fixed later, according to me, it was a sandbox, no, and okay, mostly bro name field is good for SSC, I check and we have to put it in every place, see, everywhere, there is no, everywhere, even if there is a user agent, then you have to try it there also, put no, if it is not there and no one is blocking it, then what is the harm in doing no, if it is done, then it is fine, if not, then it is also fine, what is the harm in doing extra thing, so it


01:03:57 - 01:04:36
is like that, I mean as we do but still and still do, I mean as we do but still any idea, yes, look, we have to try everything, one minute, yes, is this done ? Or it's done, okay OS OS is okay, OS CMD, let's do double code, is the code had to be inserted, did I not have to insert it or not, I don't know, okay, so it's happening, it will be done by this, ok reminded me, I used this a lot, I used to do it many times in CTF, if I was not able to create the payload manually, I used to do this,


01:04:43 - 01:05:13
then it used to be done by this, but many times, you know, in CTF, it used to happen that I have to do it custom, no, it is written like that, you know, so I have to write it manually, then I also understood that, Python was with Jinja and ah note, in JS, there is PUG, or there is PUD, if there is anything like this, then it is PUG, I think I had also exploited that, so it's about CTF, that's not the case, no idea friend, all this is also there, look, look, the difference comes there, no, like many people will feel that why should I


01:05:13 - 01:05:43
do it here, you know, I will not even hit here, no, it's the same game, the difference comes there that you have to put in extra effort, which others are not doing, that's it It's just like that no or that's why try it everywhere, see, this has happened lol okay where was it, it is not that much friend, I mean this has become a little too easy no actually he should have made that payload, it was the real deal but okay it has been solved no but we will see, even then we will see a little bit,


01:05:43 - 01:06:24
the flag will come now, I hope because the flag was in this itself, it came in the slash flag, okay, flags are what did I give, the flag will come with this you no so I mean lol you no, I remembered that, so I was going to make it by hand but okay Is it or who all knew about this in chat, this is one by mapping SSTI, this is very old, actually it means it is very old, someone had inserted another one by forking it, but the main one is good, actually if you don't know then you can see this, no, like it is complete in it,


01:06:24 - 01:06:56
that means you can insert cookies, headers etc. everything is there, it is completely full-fledged and it identifies the state and also exploits it, so it is the same, okay, is this one found, I didn't feel like it was solved in this, now look at it, now it has happened, like someone had written that chat GPT should we look for every type of vulnerability, absolutely, you know, that is called methodology, how do you think, as soon as I got access to it, I didn't stop there, you know, it is visible, the access impact is not being created, no, actually it would


01:06:56 - 01:07:36
have been created, like if it was a real world target, it would have been created, you can send it to someone, you know this get URL and he will click and so on, but like that you also write up I also have this, okay, so did you know, okay, okay, no, I haven't read that write-up, what is being talked about, but I mean it was a long time ago before CTF, it's been 5 years since that thing was submitted, anyway, let's give it three years, now what can I say, anyway, this is an old tool, friend, I mean it's very old, I remember it from a long time ago,


01:07:37 - 01:08:12
SSTI map, okay, it's done, now see what did you get to learn from this, I mean what did you get to learn, wait a minute, what is TPL map for SSTI, I have heard this TPL, I don't remember, friend, usually this type of things are used only in CTF, you know, in bug hunting, things have to be done manually, you know, I mean I don't remember, you know, the last time I used a lot of such tools for something, you know, things are done manually, so I have my own tools, so I use them a lot, but such things become useful for exploitation, things are not that complex, you


01:08:12 - 01:08:40
just have to identify them. Is that yes this is you know let's it is worthwhile you know it means it becomes visible that it is worthwhile one has to waste time on it waste time means one has to invest then one comes to know whether it has been wasted or will one really get something, so it is that kind of thing no yes but I have heard no or do you think that it's best to learn by solving CTF and learn the concept along the way or it would be better to pick one bug at a time or it is a yes pick one bug at time and read


01:08:40 - 01:09:13
everything that exists than follow that with up yes see Shreyas has written okay tell me this is a very good question I have done CTF yaar so I won't be able to tell you exactly how it is you know look I think it is a matter of time in lets means one has a lot of time with lets like I had earlier you know I don't have that much now but I had a lot of time earlier so I have learned from CTF only you know everything like playing CTF etc and this is not Hack the Box this is a lab you know CTF is different, CTF is called


01:09:13 - 01:09:51
CTF, right? It means it is CTF and here there are lists of CTF, so this is actually, I mean there is a leader board in it, people comment, you know, so look, so many people have participated, you know 288, here, you know, and these are teams, in this, if you see even three members from let's, then 3 * 3 = 9, means at least 1000 people were playing, this is the city, right? 1000 people minimum, okay, so this is called a city, you know, it happens in run time and many people also make it on real world challenges, so it is like that, this Hack the Box, you know, these are labs,


01:09:51 - 01:10:31
no machines and what they call labs, that is, this is what it means to do, but I did it from here, okay, actually, I saw much later that there is such a thing as Hack the Box, so much later, I mean, I saw when I saw it, I have to see when it happened, anyway, so I learned from this, during CTF time, you no and ah is like that so I did it through CTF because I had a lot of time, so I don't know that much about the second one, I think for those who have less time and they have to do things fast, you know, money etc. and all this will be for them, I guess like that but I


01:10:31 - 01:11:03
have done CTF with practice on less based on these concepts, see friend, let me tell you about learning, it is a good interesting thought, this is fine, now see, you solved it, it means the flag has come, okay, what did you learn, I mean I didn't learn anything from it, you know, a lot of my time was wasted from it, actually, you know, if I had made it by hand, yes, I mean I learned one thing that You know, that detection which I already knew, so not much happened from that thing, you know see how is the learning, you have to try a lot of things, so many write


01:11:06 - 01:11:31
ups are open here, don't you know, so many things are open, so you know each and everything in it has to be read, you know like this, one should read from the beginning, actually, how does this happen, why does it happen, no, then this comes after self, then after this, how to proceed, how to load all its modules, no, then we enter, there is a lot of things, one has to read the entire text, so it is like that, no, and like that, learning happens from this, then we read a lot of things like this, then


01:11:31 - 01:12:00
it becomes stronger because majority of the people don't do it, okay, you are understanding, yes, it is like that, so this is called learning, actually, right, yes, which has not happened yet, which should have happened here, just like that, instead of this thing of getting a direct flag, you know, it is like that, many people will feel that no, you got the flag, no, I have learned anything. You did not learn, actually you know this, what did the tool do, what did you do, so it is like that, no learning means you know A to Z,


01:12:00 - 01:12:32
you should read each and every thing in depth from lets, this is a very easy challenge you know, but still you should read completely on this from A to Z, what happened from where, no, what is there in globals, then we load all the modules, then inside the module and dot os, then how does the argument get parsed in it, even if you load os from lets, then you will have to write the id, which command do you want to run, how will it get parsed, so from all of them it is called learning, no that kind of thing, learn means see, in learning the end result does not matter, it is


01:12:32 - 01:13:03
not even solved, and we make it by hand, so I am telling you, how many people are watching here, 20 people are watching, if 20 people had learned more, then that is called learning, no end result, when they go into battle, then the end result matters, but in learning that process matters and it fails or One passes not by that but the process that matters, it remains the same, learning and there is a difference in it, right? If it is like that, then it is the same thing, okay, so that's the thing, so it is


01:13:06 - 01:13:37
8:13, right? Will we take the next challenge, okay? Let's take the next one, drop it, take the easy instance only, okay, and if it is webic, then it means if it is a bug bunty calculation, then it will remain according to that, okay, this has been solved, no, let 's see only the hacks, this is also very easy, see, it is very easy, does not mean that it will be solved as quickly as possible, no, no, I did it by hand, so it probably would have taken me one hour, so my memory is not that fresh, I have done this before as well, this same thing, but


01:13:41 - 01:14:14
I did it many years ago, so I actually do not remember, is it like that, okay, so you must have understood what I am telling everyone, I hope the streams are equal, right? Because I am not able to see, yes, it means they are equal, if not, then I hope they are equal, okay, that means everyone can see it. If it is and you can hear it, otherwise it's just fine, yes it is equal, okay yes, it's just the same Shreyas, it's the same thing, that process matters, no, so one has to look at the process, what have you learned, what is it, not how, one


01:14:16 - 01:14:41
has to look at it in depth completely and from that only learning happens, it's like that, that's why I don't use chat GPT, I shouldn't even have used this tool, but I have done it, no, that's it, the matter is done, okay and if it's like that, then it's okay, let 's take the next question and what do you say in that, it's a very good and important question, no, that's what learning is from this and what else is there, this is what makes one strong, friend, I mean I


01:14:41 - 01:15:06
have become like that, no, and I will play a little more CTF etc., I have missed all my practice, no, no, that means there is a lot of bug bounty, bug bounty, no, and there is no progress in bug bounty, progress means how is it, how is the thing about bug bounty, which you already know, you have to implement that, you have to find it, its strategy is a little different Yes, this is real learning from here, you know, I mean you get to learn a lot and a lot remains, no, and patience develops, a lot of things happen, no, what is that, so it


01:15:06 - 01:15:45
is like that, no, that's the thing, okay, let's see next, okay, this is also a tool for testing sssrf, yes, I have heard, I have not used it or like pic picco CTF is quite good brother, agribo all the time learning mostly hunt for idore and file mostly broken edge ido stuff, yes, by the way, it is of that type, friend, it also submits privilege escalation a lot. Yes, but I write that idor or broken access only when I submit the category, so that's why a lot is seen in it as well, but okay how often do you solve these


01:15:45 - 01:16:11
labs, do you separate time for learning every week? No, it's not like that, I am doing this after a long time, and I have also subscribed to it, so it should be worth the money, otherwise it's like that, and I don't do that much, friend, that's why I thought of this YouTube channel, no, if I do it regularly, it will be good and there will be easy challenges, and if it doesn't happen, it's okay, but I won't do this tool business next time, okay, I will do it completely by hand, I will read each and every thing, ah my memory


01:16:11 - 01:16:37
was not that fresh, otherwise it can also be done in a single shot, it's not as tough as it looks, actually a lot of people must have already solved this in the chat, okay, that means it wasn't such a tough challenge, but okay, no, I won't do that much with these tools, the SQL map is a different matter, there is a little bit of SQL map in SQL injection, etc. Okay because it really takes a lot of time otherwise it is there in it, if you fetch things manually then it is a different matter, okay no I


01:16:37 - 01:17:11
am not that weak, no I do it only when I have submitted a lot of bugs and they are pending, it is not that I am waiting for the bounties or not, I mean I have some free time, then only I do all this on labs or cctfor, well if any cctf has come then I do it etc. there is no such fix, I mean it should be there right now but it is not there bro sometimes I got frustrated when I try to understand the application, okay then I think that one should learn the developer's site first, what should one learn at all, look learning the developer's site means many people misunderstand, people think


01:17:11 - 01:17:37
that you have to become a developer, you should develop some application, no not at all, so this thing like playing CTF etc. is written in it, reading a code it is understandable, how it is and how it is not If it is there then it becomes clear to me, I have understood the developer's side from here, so it is like that, I did not understand it earlier, earlier I used to avoid looking at the source code, you know, that means there was not going to be any source code in Bug Bunty, then what would happen by looking at it here, you know, so it is like that but I see, I


01:17:37 - 01:18:09
definitely see, you know, and from this I understand a lot, how does that developer write, what is it, why is it there and I understand a lot, don't I, and it becomes clear that understanding increases from that, so do it the way it is, as it is shown on the screen, you should do the same, okay Anupam's question was, okay yes or okay goods, okay and great two glasses bro and bro do you look for one type on everything, so I see everything, I mean I look at it according to the target, like now


01:18:09 - 01:18:37
see, for example, like this challenge, no, now I was doing access work in it, but there is no meaning by accessing, there is not going to be any impact from it, the same happens in Bug Bunty as well, no, some things are not going to be found in this challenge It means there is not that much scope there, so why are you looking for that thing so it is like this, no it is like that, it is like that, so I told you that you have to see what is that application, no how much it is, how it is like ah you


01:18:37 - 01:19:09
know there are multiple APIs, no if it goes too much then there will be 100% load balancer, that will be there, you know and there will be reverse proxy and then you can get a partner like that, otherwise there is such thinking, so you have to understand the application, what is it and what is not, okay brother, do you only test for web assets and other assets, IPS etc. and web assets are just like that, I also know binary exploitation but I have never made any money in that, but I am ready and yes,


01:19:09 - 01:19:42
reversing APK etc. all this is also known to me, I do all that as well, okay and recently I have got a good lead, I am working on it, I will tell you next time, no how is it, do you hunt on multi program at once how long are you Stay n why are these always repetitive questions but everyone's questions are also similar, that's why no, that's why it is repetitive, one should do it for at least a week, no hunt means understanding comes on one target, etc. nothing else, I make programs for myself, that means I have programs in my mind which I


01:19:42 - 01:20:14
use, that means I keep following them, in the sense that if I get a little bored then I shift the program, then it keeps revolving in that circle only, Charap There are programs, it's like that in between them, I mean brother, brother, did you not hunt on Amazon, did you see it on that leader board? No, you have not done it at all, but I have a program, yes, you must have seen it on the collab, my name is visible, right? Yes, but no, I have not done that, I will never do it on Amazon. You know, I am a big buntee, I am still thinking, you know, I should go for the bigger bounties, you know, I usually


01:20:14 - 01:20:40
play within 3K, 5K, you know, and 10K, the programs, no, I have not gone out that much, you know, I should go for the ones above 10K because how is it in that, let's have a bug in it, I mean Amazon does it for 12, no, something of this type of $12.5, you know, $2000 is a very good amount for a bug, so it will be worth it for the whole month, you know, if it 's that type of thing, then definitely, you should do it for bigger boundaries, you know, you should definitely do it, otherwise, how is it, then to reach 12, you know, 4 * 3 = 12,


01:20:40 - 01:21:15
I mean you I will have to submit three of them to reach 12 and taking out the critical three times, it is not that easy, it is like that, they slip out of my hand, but it is like that, so that is the same thing, brother, do you have a routine, brother, for bug hunting etc., how do you make a process for hunting, no, friend, I don't have that much of a routine, I am a little late in the morning, so I should get up a little early in the morning, no, by the way, once I get up, then the work should be done properly, there is progress, then only after that I sleep,


01:21:15 - 01:21:49
that's how do you give meaning to every bug hunting session, the target should be learned, no, I mean, did I learn something new about the target, it should be like that, if I don't find a bug, then also I do the same after thinking, and brother, after recording the video, the dialogue, no, well, I read Hindi a little slow, okay, I have to write in English only, I mean, I read a little slow, I don't know how to read, but I read slowly, will you post it or not, okay, will you post it, will you put me in the dialogue or


01:21:49 - 01:22:19
not, yes, it will remain Friend, it will be unlisted after that I will make it public then it will be there immediately you will be able to see it immediately when the stream ends, okay then it will be there, okay honestly speaking, sometimes I also watch my own videos or what I have done before once or twice, so you know, it is the same thing, no and like that, sometimes I also get to learn from myself, so like that there are a lot of things, I think it is right, but I don't do it myself, so I watch my own videos, which I


01:22:19 - 01:22:51
have given before, nothing like that, you know, it is the same thing, so I also watch it myself, actually if I tell you honestly, then it is okay and bro can you tell me some tips for information disclosure and bypass information disclosure word list etc. make it well and learn to hit a little well, write a tool, script etc. in which you put the URL and it will hit, so make it of that type, and like that about information disclosure, I have made it and I do other things, I will not make it public but I am giving you an idea what should happen and what should


01:22:51 - 01:23:19
not happen auth bypass, okay authorization bypass, so try removing the cookie, you know, the testing should be fast, first in the sense that like here, no, and decisions should be made quickly, what will happen here, what will not happen, what can happen, what cannot happen, no, and after testing quickly, one has to move away, one does not have to sit holding only this one, the tab second in the repeater, one does not have to sit holding only this, so a fast decision has to be taken after thinking, no, thought about it and quickly moved away, this


01:23:19 - 01:23:51
will happen there, if it seemed interesting then I wrote it, no, it is interesting, okay, it is interesting, for what is it interesting because here SSTI is visible, has it happened or not, so you know not yet explained, okay, I will write not yet explained, okay, then it is written like that, so it is of this type, so it is the same thing, that has to be done fast, if you are asking things according to the boundary, then yes, how do you make this, friend No, it is very different, what is the name of this


01:23:51 - 01:24:27
Twitter, sorry, the YouTube chat is very different, why is it so small, it doesn't get bigger, is this ok, right? [Music] People keep on asking, I keep taking the next challenge, but only half an hour is left, let's take it, I have taken it, okay, let's take it, and who has written what, bro I got employee data disclosure, but it's on the third level sub domain, store it, I mean, think whether he will pay the money or not, if he won't pay, then don't submit, it will be expected,


01:24:27 - 01:24:58
look, otherwise keep it, store it, if it comes in scope in the future also, then do it. take it or else try it and see if it's okay if not then it's okay no because what's the harm in doing it what will happen at the most you know at the most it is -5 in the case of karvan no in the back round then even that doesn't remain the accuracy decreases only and usefully you know otherwise they will close the inflection it will be at zero only there is no such loss no try it if it's okay if it's okay also it's okay you know it's like that


01:24:58 - 01:25:26
thank you ok okay Mayur okay this stream is for professional I got it why have you written like this this is exactly what I am currently suffering from I feel like I am spending a little time on one thing you know yes look you have to do it fast this is true this used to happen with me also but it was a matter of a long time ago it doesn't happen that much now such an instant has come no so it is like that and it is like that same do you have made your own word list write for the announcement disclose yes


01:25:26 - 01:25:58
absolutely I have made it myself majority of all the things are my own you know only just ice sweet You know the ice belongs to someone else no the rest I have written everything myself no brother or okay I have one question when I choose ATT program okay I was not able to test because I cannot sign up there see this sign up thing is very great no and what happens many times people are not able to get in and you go in you are not able to get in and people go then they get bugs no such thing so you will have to figure out


01:25:58 - 01:26:36
how to sign up what to do no that is part of the game that is what I do look for un authenticated bugs I have got all the domains so I do it I do a little thinking for that too so I do all that you know there is an information disclosure some form etc so I try for its blind access or I see something and this type or not so much for un authenticated I look more at the authenticated one okay and people keep coming okay what R top five favorite bug, look I earn everything sir top five etc. there is nothing like that no whatever I got it is good like that sir top five is nothing but


01:26:36 - 01:27:09
which thing excites me, part traversal etc excites me a lot I don't know why it is very interesting friend I mean going to the server side and doing that I like it, honestly tell me it is interesting and x also seems very interesting and what else is interesting is there multiple chaining etc in idors etc. something might leak from somewhere it is not that doing multiple chain in idors that seems very interesting to me I mean it is very interesting so it is like that there are two-three things like that rest whatever I got is done it is good it is like that and it


01:27:09 - 01:27:58
is like that okay let's do the next one now it is only okay okay in this do we have to download the file only x instance is there directly okay okay right it is good okay there is no source code in it okay let's see what it is what does it say okay Okay, no problem, what does field to connect mean , okay, only x, all right, why is the name like this? This is a porn box machine here, okay, this is not mine, my computer is very different, you know, so a little bit better, you know, the same bro, keep the Q&A


01:28:25 - 01:28:54
session, everybody is a lot to ask elite like you, Siddharth said, no friend, I am not that elite, I don't think so, honestly, tell me, you know, just because a little bit, not a little bit, I have earned a lot of good money, just that doesn't make me elite, no, there is a lot more left, friend, I mean there is a lot more left, you know, it will be almost 2 years for me, in 2 months, for full time, so yes, it is like that, I am not that elite, friend, I don't feel like elite, no, there is


01:28:54 - 01:29:28
a lot more to do, this is that, and I am enjoying, I am just doing it, there is a little tension about money, friend, I have taken the decision that I am not going to do a job, so all this, that college, I mean, I had taken the decision long ago That I will not do a job so I do not have any other option to earn money, as it is right now and I am definitely after the money, of course I am okay, of course I am after money, and but it is not so much that you know I am not elite, I am just doing that,


01:29:28 - 01:30:27
I want to remain on top, I will see for many years brother then ok this was the login is this sign up okay let's write the test test@test.com 23 test mail okay one minute what is the email why is it like this okay who is the user already exists friend this text Okay, okay is it for profile picture upload, is it interesting is it for file upload, now see like this is for upload, so what can happen in it, no yes, what can happen, okay, one thing is that there will be unrestricted file upload, no,


01:30:36 - 01:31:04
something with access is uploaded and then that access is getting triggered, you know, something like that can happen in that file or the file can get overwritten, no, so this type of thinking remains that this can happen with this feature, that can happen with it, no, that thing is trusted, no, this type of good x Anupam has asked xc SQL RC this type of critical bugs are they found trick and main yes, main, mine is mainly a web app one, it is found in all domains, no, is it of this type, I mean the main


01:31:04 - 01:31:35
application is not authenticated, which people use, you know, it is like that, sometimes it is found from the surface also, while reconning, have you found something, easy like this, easy means if there was a directory brute force somewhere, then if you found direct file upload there, you know and Is it PAP or something else, no, I have uploaded the webshell and got RCE, so if this type also happens, it is like that, it is just like that, okay, look, you have to see that earlier also someone had asked me in DM that ah


01:31:35 - 01:32:17
how does this critical look, look, critical looks like this that Abhinav Bansal asked brother how to contact you, why do you want to do it, first write that, then I will tell you where to do it, okay, so how is critical, you have to read a lot of write-ups etc., so you will get an understanding from the write-up, you will get an understanding, the user name and already exists, what is a joke, how can this previous what exist, friend, I am not joking, this is all a goods article from Medium, is it absolutely true or generated, friend,


01:32:22 - 01:32:47
why do people write like this, I don't understand, it means you got an access, you are writing a write-up about it in Medium, I mean you are okay, why are you writing like this, I mean who is going to learn what from it, I mean you searched and you got the money Hey, it's a very good thing, no, and every small thing also matters, you know, I mean whether you get money or not, that's also fine, but you have got access, no, it 's a very good thing in the real world, but why do you want to write like this, you know, it's so straight for light, you


01:32:47 - 01:33:11
know, time pass, this has become very that, you know, I mean the whole medium, according to me, should start taking money from people who write this type of thing, or people flex bro on medium, that I write, you know, blogsvlogs, this, that, now what you write is also important, you know, you'll write anything like this, just to pass time, no, so that means it's very useless, friend, this is absolutely true, and this has started in the recent year, it wasn't there at all before, you know, earlier write-


01:33:11 - 01:33:48
ups used to be a very useful thing, you know, and it used to be a lot, now people write anything, I mean, they even write fabricated things about someone, everyone passes time, it's completely brother to each other, that is understandable only by looking at it, but it's, no, I mean, this is a write-up for time pass and this is not for time pass, no, so Look exactly what do you register friend what happened well in this you have to see what is it asking this is the username and profile profile first of all let's login no user gender interest


01:34:14 - 01:34:50
is okay what does it say exists in this why does it say like this chat gpt has spoiled everything yes it is true very true no specially it is worst on lindin I don't even have Lindin you know I will tell you mine the day I cross 800 I will delete Lindin the day I created it I put it on hibernate that day I deactivated it no one can see it then that profile you know and till now it is the same every month I get a message that your profile is on hibernate and it will remain the same the day I cross $800 no so or $1 million


01:34:52 - 01:35:19
I will delete it that day I have never used it and I don't even want to use it it is a very useless thing friend I mean Lindin etc you know by saying good and big things I mean you got followers what's the use of that It means the stomach grows a bit, friend, because of that, you know, do you want to look big or do you want to become big, no, that is something you should decide for the people who are Lindin, well I have written this, okay, only hacks, okay, only why is it not registering,


01:35:22 - 01:36:09
what does this mean, what is going on, I am doing something wrong, I don't even have the source code, for a minute, does it mean it wants to let you in, it doesn't want to. I want to know if it can be an injection, okay, let's put it in, let's put it in for this injection, we will sit and see, okay and why is it not registering in this, okay, someone has written Push Mehra, okay brother, don't think too much, just do it, it 's not good, it's true, it's true or not, I also think a lot, even now I


01:36:52 - 01:37:47
tell myself this, don't think too much, just do it, it's true, isn't it true, Papa Papa Papa Papa, okay and Papa, there is no photo-vote, first let me get in, what is this email, then exist, what all is going on, this signing up, is this a challenge, is it not like this, okay, let's give him proof, is there any photo, where is the photo, was it good in B.Tech, was it on CG or not, how do I tell you, college means it's not like that, I was not good in studies, but I know friend, I don't want to do all that, no


01:38:08 - 01:38:37
, it was like that, it was good, it was 8 points something, honestly, I don't even remember and people used to ask me in that college, how much did you get in CGP, etc., all that happened, how many marks did you have, I don't even look at it. I don't even remember anything, you know how much it was, you know, and I mean I have zero idea, no, I mean what is 8 something, I know this much, no, and I don't remember, friend, I don't remember, it must be 8.4 or 45, something like that, I have zero idea, I


01:38:37 - 01:39:08
will have to look for it, and in college also they used to ask me, I just used to think that I should pass in some backward business, I mean I won't be able to do it, it's very difficult, I won't be able to do it, I used to think that much, even like this, you know I should pass, and that's what happened, I never got any backward thing, something like this, that, like that, so that's it, I had to put that image, good Lord, what would you make, friend, people were not able to work without an image,


01:39:12 - 01:40:00
okay, now let's solve it with 60 strokes, what kind of work do you find, friend, I try everything, you know, whatever you see, you know, whatever type it is, this, that, and this is a generated image, okay , okay, so okay, it was an image once, okay, image What can happen in the path overwrite and this could be its source code is not given so random so okay what is there in it is chat is it test all right did not get a match what is it Dmitry all right all right all right okay okay you have understood it now it seems okay let's do it with that okay then


01:40:01 - 01:40:41
with this you will chat like this or like this okay hi what type of app is this yaar what is this why am I doing this here dude can you answer me okay what was written here look bro can you tell me one thing in testing there is such a whole app but what happens in that blind want to bind my berb ip but that link also ping back I'm convinced I'm not but [music] is SSRF working so ping back has come what do you mean you know if ping back has come then look no who means who is sending you no


01:40:42 - 01:41:20
ping back that IPP address look who is it who is from the company is it AWS or GCP who is it who is it from Azure I mean, from which infrastructure is the ping back coming? Okay, ping back is not coming. Okay, pingback is not coming. Then what about SSRF? There is one thing that happens by DNS rebinding, try testing that. Okay, I'll tell you in one go, DNS rebinding, okay , SSRF remains okay. This DNS, actually I'm trying DNS rebinding, okay, are you trying? Okay, okay, so what happened, DNS rebinding, so it got accepted,


01:41:30 - 01:42:13
so what happened, DNS rebinding, so it got accepted, but I want to put my barb link, okay, you 're saying barb collaborator link? I am not even able to understand with that barb link, I didn't understand, friend, what happens with barb link, it's not working, I didn't understand , nothing has happened, access, what is its scene, it didn't happen, this also did not get triggered, but it disappeared, access should come, where did it go, there is nothing in it, okay, collaborator link, that is not happening, okay, right? You mean I did not understand,


01:42:24 - 01:42:55
you are my Why do we have to do this, I mean, I don't understand actually what is the first thing, give an application, let's create a trade account, first of all I will create an account, let's see what are the privileges, you know what are the functionalities, I will see all that, you know first see the whole app, how to use it, what is it and after that do it, is that fine or the work collaborator is not working, I am also not sure why it is not working, but it is fine, by interacting with it, there is a project discovery tool, that is


01:42:55 - 01:43:56
Use it, that is also good, no, or there is a website called web dot site, I use it, it is much better, so what is the scene of this chat, jw of JWT and there is also one called token dot dev, this is also good, I like it, what is not good, okay, it is interesting, is it getting hidden, is there an internal error two three, seriously, this vulnerability was a challenge, I thought that something would happen, I was thinking that access, chat etc., whatever I saw, it seems to be access brother, anyway, friend, this


01:44:19 - 01:44:54
is easy, that's why I guess but it is okay, right, we will do it easily, so there will also be a little track on the channel, how it was before, what is it now, etc., okay and okay, okay, no one is okay, only x is done, then what is arms, okay, wewich, okay and void whisper is unholy union, it seems like SQL map, I mean it seems like SQL injection, not map, okay, okay, right, watch now, I am going to close it. Then let's answer, I have solved only two, okay and okay, let's just see the question answers, the time is up, okay, it's 15 minutes, okay,


01:44:54 - 01:45:40
I will close it at 9:00, okay so or okay, okay, let's see the questions, what is using DNS, can you tell using DNS rebinding now can you tell I want to put my barb pling over there for ping bag that's the scene, okay , I have to keep that in DNS rebinding, all right, all right, look friend, in DNS rebinding, you should have a VPS, okay, there is also a tool for DNS rebinding, okay, I will check and tell you, in this, my DNS is okay, this is the tool, okay, this tool is for DNS rebinding, that


01:45:51 - 01:46:20
means, okay, there is a local host in it and you can put yours or you can do it in any way, it's up to you, see how the game of DNS rebinding is, there is one thing called time of check time. Of use okay when things are checked it shows that you know there is some lag means any normal website then when the time of use happens that variable when used gets resolved that there is no website something like this then it takes another IP no so it keeps switching between A and B so it remains like that you know it


01:46:20 - 01:47:04
does that DNS binding you are saying that you have to put that link of the web collaborator here so I don't think it is possible actually to be honest you should put the VPS in it no means put the IPP address of your virtual private server and listen like this okay this is solved what about SKL map which one will be on 8080 no friend so it is not on 80 will it be on 8080 okay so put this you know and your IP address is already news, is it in use yes 80 remains in use okay is 80 also in use all right


01:47:10 - 01:47:43
Anyway okay so what was I saying yes so this happens here only through IP right I don't know if there is a link to Parab as well no I mean I am not aware of that or is it something like that no yes it's just that friend I don't know I mean I don't think that is possible then how did that DNS reminding happen if you want to do that on it then you know put your VPS and test it by the way okay bro I was hunting on Amazon for ok hide and it is written every single request is absolutely you know so now


01:47:43 - 01:48:21
you should write an extension then one for Bub to manage that or else a little slow down you know there are so many cookies this is that so you know or you will have to arrange it that's it you know in Bug Bunty game you should be able to do things according to your convenience no it's just that kind of thing or okay old programs really s reddit are really secure if there if there's anything you specifically do stand out and find bugs that other people might Have missed you see I usefully mean right now I mean earlier I used to give a lot of you know client side bugs


01:48:30 - 01:48:57
I mean XS this or that I mean almost all of me was focused on the client side this or that gradually I understood that not that much money is made on the client side very few programs I mean very few no there are very few programs that give so much money to the client side you know majority of them are more interested in the server side people don't know why in the client side you know after doing all this you get $500 so that remains one you know and I focus more on the server side it depends on the program let's say you said reddit if I was on reddit


01:48:57 - 01:49:27
what would I do okay if I was hunting then what would I do I look at Reddit for any hidden end point or any depreciated end point whose infrastructure is very big and there are a lot of mistakes in it. So the big programs, there are many domains of Reddit. This is what I think people get a lot of idea in Reddit. There is something like this in Reddit's scene. So I look at this type of thing. You know, I have to do a little research. Then look at his top hundred. What is he doing? What kind of reporting is he doing?


01:49:27 - 01:50:00
Look at him a little. This is a thing. You know, and I have to think a little differently from others. In short, you know, look at his Lindin profile. Who is he? What does he do? Look at his getup. Look at his Twitter. What kind of thing is it? Maybe you get that type of thing. Or you try your methodology first. What do you get? It's not that. So, this is the thing. And I do my programs after a lot of thought. If you ask me that what do you need? I don't want to hunt on Reddit, I won't say I don't have that much interest in Reddit, I


01:50:00 - 01:50:31
am interested in it, I mean I feel inside that I will do this, I am feeling interested, I mean I am feeling good that maybe this is possible, I am getting interested in it, so I do that, I don't have that much interest in Reddit, so I am like that and what else can we do, the question was that actually we can do something different, what else can we do differently, we can try GS VG Reddit client side, I see the client side on Reddit, you know I don't think many people would have done something client side on Reddit, all those


01:50:31 - 01:50:59
are Ser IDs, as much as I feel so, the credit is very big, no and I have seen the client side, I have seen this type and the bug of a particular type cannot be told like that, that too cannot be told without seeing, when we see it then we get an idea that what to do and what not to do, like that, okay and then say so you mean I have to make my own server, there I have to use for that SSRF because it is vulnerable for DNS rewiring as I said, yes then only you will get ping back, I mean only then ping


01:50:59 - 01:51:32
back will come, you need an IP address to which it will be forwarded, only then ping back will come, you know so it is such a thing like no, so here you will have to enter the IP, if it happens then write it down, not on Twitter because it also happens, as much as I know here, I enter my own you know, I enter the IP of my VPS and enter, then it has to listen here, okay, then if the ping back comes, it is okay, if it does not come, then it is not vulnerable, okay, if it is like that, then yes you will have to do that, okay and


01:51:32 - 01:52:04
from where do I get the technical write up, okay, there is direct exploitation on the activity, not much details, friend, I stopped reading the activity, I don't know why, ever since they have changed the you know interface, I mean I don't feel like opening it at all, I have my own bot, I have written a script which keeps giving me you know on the slag What do you say, if anything new happens then it is rendered like many people have written on Twitter of that type, so I read there only, then I click and


01:52:07 - 01:52:49
do not see the rest, it is very dirty, it was very good earlier, no, and this they have put this on the page, no, it is very bad, I do not like it at all, I did not like it at all, or does Reddit disclose, it does not, I guess it must be doing well, friend, okay, you can see, no, it is of that type, the question was good, but by the way, do not look at Reddit, I say Reddit activity, friend, okay, I mean you should also read on activity, whatever is there, old or that is a pentest landed, you know, the archive of write-ups is with them


01:52:50 - 01:53:16
and they do not update it, it seems they have closed it, but there are good ones written in it, no, and very old ones are written, meaning you will find very old ones of 2016-15 as well, you know, and if you do not find any write-up from let's if it is deleted, then that which is not a web back machine, then They keep links for that too, so that is the best, I used to study there only and even when I was in college time, I used to study there, I mean I used to study a lot, I mean if I got even 2 minutes of free time in college, I


01:53:16 - 01:53:45
would open my mobile and read a write up, I mean it was like that, I used to read a lot of stuff. I read a lot, I mean I have learnt from reading only, I have not seen less than videos, I mean I have not seen video content that much at that time, actually I mean it was very basic, they used to be there, don't tell me about the script guys, this and that, I don't care about that, so if it is like that, it is by landing a fantasy, okay, I will tell you that, if it has come till here, then


01:53:50 - 01:54:18
Integrity has acquired it or it is sponsored, I am not sure, but these people have stopped it, no, look, this has not happened after 24, there has been no update, so I used to read here only and it goes till very old, okay, what have you done friend, how is it coming till here, we used to read it even before 2021, no, I don't know what these people have done, look, even of 2013, well, this pub added and the date of publication is different, so look, you will find the publications of 2013 also here, okay, like


01:54:18 - 01:54:53
what is there here, the script enablement of Amazon packaging feedback cross, okay, so look, if you remove this, then use that link and from here Check if someone has posted it here, okay, it has been posted here, okay, it is 13 years old, right? So, let's see here, I hope there is nothing wrong there, yes, it is equal, okay, so this was it, let's read it, it has come, okay, so what did you get here, it is from 2013, I mean, how many years have passed, it is 12 years old, and the Amazon package feedback cross


01:55:06 - 01:55:35
scripting vulnerability, I have received an order from Amazon, okay, the URL was printed, so it is a very good thing, okay, and there was a packaging feedback form, no, there is a QR etc., we scan it, etc., and then the form opens, tell me your feedback, it has not been yours for 20 minutes, this type of things were there, okay, after a few deadlinks, I noticed that the form used hidden input, yes, look, it got this, failed, ah, sorry, failure, read, redirect, okay, it got the parameter, okay, I


01:55:35 - 01:56:14
am not looking below, but usefully, I think there will be something like this, JavaScript alert, is it not good, anyway, sorry, so something of this type It would be like that, right? The attack by default, okay. All right, I don't read that loudly, but I read very fast, that means it is my habit. No, I don't know how other people read, but I read very fast, that means very fast, that means I don't know if someone here reads faster than me, but okay, so let's see the attack. What are these codes? Onload GS,


01:56:16 - 01:56:57
okay, we are interesting. This is good, okay. So, they have done the same in double quotes and after doing this, they have written this by breaking here. This is the actual code here. So the reflection that happens here, I guess the expert was posting the form. Well, it was post based. Well, it was post based. So, there won't be any CSRF token etc. at that time, I know, it is like that. So, if you write the code for this value here, it breaks here. And after that, this alert becomes the main payload and comes here. So,


01:56:57 - 01:57:39
the redirect is variable, okay. It has been declared but after that this alert remains here okay and it pops up and the document document dot cookie gets stolen so this was post base access and it was quite good how much money did you get for it it doesn't have any money where is the money test it again fix it was interesting nothing it was post base access and there was a hidden parameter on it so that's it it was good it was okay anyway so what else did you ask now many people have written that again okay now where was it okay Siddharth had asked


01:57:39 - 01:58:08
from where should I get the technical so get it from here it means read it from here okay Siddharth then what is it Bhavin Patel bro I was hunting on Amazon okay this is done okay okay this also happened where are you from bro I am from India only I am talking in Hindi no friend it doesn't tell location etc. where am I from etc. but okay there is nothing like that it is not very special there is something like that but there is no point in talking about all that okay how do we learn bugs at a time and then hunt it Learn on a public


01:58:09 - 01:58:40
program, from where do you learn, you know there are a lot of things to learn, so look friend, now how do I explain that, you know, you should play CTF etc., start reading a bit, you know there is money, I have read from books, I have done a lot of things from books, so those are the same old books, do a random search and there used to be a free PDF download, I used to click on it and read in it, so I have done that, do you read JS files, if yes then How do you download and read them locally I have my own tools etc. so


01:58:40 - 01:59:09
I read all of them in VS code I read all of them sometimes sub text sometimes I read on VS code JavaScript is my own tools etc. you know so I have written all the things in it you know and I read in it only I am like that Paint land is good for yes absolutely I mean it is quite good in it and I don't pass time usefully in it I don't know why I think they read it themselves is there anything like that which people add earlier is it useful I don't pass time at all so if your current knowledge is gone how would


01:59:09 - 01:59:48
you start let's say what would be your approach for the first three months you know what would I do no I don't know what would I do I don't know how I have learned it no I don't have that much idea about starting I don't know genuinely I don't even remember how I learned it no so I mean I don't remember starting at all actually I knew programming etc. quite well you know already I mean even before hacking I had learnt that from books etc. so I came from there and I don't genuinely remember it, I mean what will I


01:59:49 - 02:00:27
do, I will learn Linux etc. first of all how to use it, how to use it etc. it happens gradually from that, no I guess from the basic use of Linux I don't know genuinely I will have to give a lot of thought to that question, no it is a very good question Mr. Robot has asked, okay brother your wifi is so slow, by the way thanks for the stream your wifi is so slow why are you saying so, friend where is it slow, friend not at the fastest 300M mbps, I am not going to open speedtest.net, okay it shows the IP on it, okay


02:00:31 - 02:00:59
so I will open it on fast.com only, okay and how much time do you spend on learning and hunting, I don't keep reading that much on learning, write up time to time I am not very dedicated to such learning, if I see something good then I read it, okay how do you understand technical writers, just keep reading Until you understand it, okay how do you do if you don't understand keep reading the write up, right? As I said till you understand I mean 10 some write ups, so in the starting days I used to read it 10-10 times,


02:00:59 - 02:01:39
five times, eight times, 10 times, 15 times and no, so like that keep reading until you understand how much time you spend on 1 minute, right? It's 9:01 now, okay, I will take one last question, then I am going to close it, okay, it's 9:01 now, okay , low stream quality is low stream quality, I mean you four, this is streaming at 2K, right? This is streaming at 2K, right? That means yes, you can do it at 2K, right? Its quality, I mean I didn't understand, you know, this much is clear, friend, it is streaming at 2K,


02:01:39 - 02:02:14
I am opening it myself and seeing it, or I mean, look at it on the computer, mobile, don't look at it, okay, let's take one last question, would you focus on the client side, or rather, the client side and the server side, if you Are you a beginner who does the server side of the client side, not the server side, the client side is done in the beginning, actually in the server side, the one that is for the beginning is very easy, but if we go a little deeper then the difficulty level and complexity increases a little, but I start from the client side, no, the tough


02:02:19 - 02:02:46
things should be done first, then the easy things, and easy means it becomes this much, it depends, I am not saying that the server side is easy, but I do it from the client side, my personal one, I did it with that and then later I went to the server side, okay, now let's close the streamer, it's 9:00, I have 2 minutes extra, okay and okay, then this will remain archived, see, if there is anything left, write it in the comment and you can also give feedback on Twitter, etc. and okay, then we will see next time, you know I may be on Saturday,


02:02:46 - 02:03:08
Sunday, etc., okay, so we will do it a little better and this was not that good, I felt, I did not learn anything that much, actually you know, I did not learn anything, I read that write up, it was quite good but That too, you know, I already know post base access, so anyway I hope you guys have learnt it and then we will meet next time, okay bye
